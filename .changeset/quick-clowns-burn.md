A staging or prod deploy role can create a custom domain of any name (`POST` on `/domainnames` has no name condition), can edit routes, integrations and stages under another HTTP API's id, and can change a hostname in a sub-zone of its apex whose label ends with `-<product>-stg` or `-<product>` (for example `api-x-stg.foo-basefresh-stg.pebbletech.my`); API Gateway tag updates after creation are denied, and creation-time tags still arrive through `CreateApi`.
